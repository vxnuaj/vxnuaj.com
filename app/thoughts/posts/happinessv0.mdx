Wrote this on a whim (apple notes + commute) -- most of it will only make sense to me.


first and foremost, chasing happiness is a self-fulfilling prophecy for unhappiness. being able to naturally set yourself up for it is a better way to increase P(happiness). i always use “P(happiness)” as there can be unknown variables for it. and there is no single definitive thing for it. that being said,

you don’t need anything external to be happy. i’d argue desiring more and satisfying the desire lowers your probability for happiness (happiness isn’t necessarily pleasure / gratification) in the long run.
(a more rigorous term is hedonic adaptation)

a concept i like to use are nth order desires. if you satisfy a desire where n = 1, and the desire either misaligns with your ego or causes a spike on your hedonic wave there’s a higher P(unhappiness) as time goes on. the greater ||misalignment w ego|| or ||spike on hedonic wave|| is, the greater P(unhappiness).

increasing probability for happiness is more correlated about things that you create / do that allow for expressiveness of your ego on the long term ( this falters when base egoism -> egotism, as it turns into a 1st order desire that misaligns with your ego — pretty ironically).

when you and what you can do becomes your own playground, you need nothing more but continuously just be yourself (if you’re highly curious, the “what you can do” becomes greater as you listen to the curiosity)

you definitely need base needs, meaning bottom two steps of maslow’s hierarchy of needs, with some of the 3rd (depending on your psyche)

then i’d argue it’s more about the top of maslow’s hierarchy, self-sustained actualization of the ego — ikigai seems to be the best model for this, though in reality things are more nuanced.

i like the perspective of happiness as naval’s : peace is happiness at rest, happiness is peace in motion — you get happiness from being able to actively solve your own problems (infinitely big or infinitesimally small) such that you’re able to create peace for yourself, while being in motion (solving problems).

then being able to solve your own problems really becomes a matter of optimizing max(agency) (this is why i say “agency is all you need”).

remark — egoism isn’t bad its inherent to the human species, i see even altruism being a form of egoism that happens to benefit others… think of it as “how can you want you do something good for others where it completely misaligns with who you are?”. or watch, the friends scene in youtube titled “There are no good deeds”

remark — i conjecture you want your nth order desires to naturally express themselves, where n > 1 in a compounding manner over a long period of time — an extreme way to put it, and cooler imo “package your obsession into something that compounds”

remark — you can fine tune your 1st order desires to naturally serve your higher order desires. comes with environment design and perspective shifts 

remark — “you only need yourself” — why do you think founders are fulfilled by building out their life’s mission, artists are by creating masterpieces of art, scientists by relentlessly exploring their curiosity, and athletes by constantly overcoming their physical limits. its all compounded self expressiveness — egoism.

theorem — depending on things to the point where you feel you NEED them can drastically lower P(happiness), depending on context.
