I was recently watching [Yann LeCun's](https://x.com/ylecun) NYU lecture on ConvNets and came accross their, and how they were biologically inspired by the 
human brain (per Kunikhiko Fukushima's paper, *[Neocognitron: A Self-organizing Neural Network Model for a Mechanism of Pattern Recognition Unaffected by Shift in Position](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr08/cos598B/Readings/Fukushima1980.pdf)*)
<br/>
Never imagined there would be that much of a direct connection between early versions of CNNs and the biological human brain.

<br/>
To be fair, I always had some intuition that neural networks were constructed from a biological basis / inspiration of the human brain, but when I learnt that the visual cortex performed a type of 
pooling operation, similar to how a CNN performs the convolution opration, it sorta lit a spark in my mind
<br/>

> I've always been curious to understand how we can *reverse engineer* intelligence, to the point to which we can automate any task via an artificial neural network, reading about this direct connection was pretty exciting.
<br/>

Though of course, CNNs are nowhere near resembling how the actual visual cortex works, missing many key roles, i.e., neurotransmitters,

Loading -- chill i just made this website last night.  

<br/>

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


class NN():
    def __init__(self, n_features):
        self.n_features = n_features

```
<br/>


$\text{hello} \begin{pmatrix} 1, 2 \\ 3, 4 \end{pmatrix}$

cool got latex & code to work within .mdx files

<br/>

```math
\frac{∂J}{∂Z_2} = (\frac{∂J}{∂A_2})(\frac{∂A_2}{∂Z_2}) = A_2 - Y 
\\[1em]\\[1em]
\frac{∂J}{∂W_2} = (\frac{∂J}{∂A_2})(\frac{∂A_2}{∂Z_2})(\frac{∂Z_2}{∂W_2}) = \frac{1}{m} (A_2 - Y)A_1^T
\\[1em]\\[1em]
\frac{∂J}{∂B_2} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m(\frac{∂J}{∂A_2})(\frac{∂A_2}{Z_2})(\frac{∂Z_2}{B_2}) =  \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m A_2 - Y
